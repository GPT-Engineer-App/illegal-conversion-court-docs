# illegal-conversion-court-docs

Please gather data, datasets of court case documents, motions, and decisions/orders related to NYC housing court involving illegal apartments converted from commercial to residential, contradicting the certificate of occupancy and/or lacking a certificate of occupancy. Ensure the data is sourced from reliable databases such as NYC housing court databases, PACER, Westlaw, or LexisNexis.

Focus on collecting court filings, motions, decisions/orders, and legal briefs specifically related to illegal conversions and occupancy certificate issues. Annotate each document with relevant labels including case type, key issues, and outcomes. Capture details such as laws referenced, key arguments, and final rulings.

Clean the data by removing irrelevant information and standardizing formats. Normalize the text to a uniform format, such as lowercasing and removing special characters, and tokenize if necessary.

Ensure the dataset is accurate, consistent, and diverse, covering a wide range of cases and scenarios. Document the sources, selection criteria, and annotation guidelines thoroughly. Maintain version control to track changes and updates.

Define a sufficient dataset size for robust model training and set aside a portion of the dataset as a validation set to evaluate model performance. Establish a feedback loop to continuously improve the dataset based on model performance and expert feedback.

Output the final dataset as a simple static HTML page with necessary CSS files. Organize the data in a structured format that can be easily converted to CSV if needed, ensuring each entry includes annotations and metadata.
